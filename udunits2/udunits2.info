1 Introduction
**************

The UDUNITS-2 package provides support for units of physical quantities.
Its three main components are: 1) *note a C library: (udunits2lib)Top.
for units of physical quantities; 2) *note a utility:
(udunits2prog)Top.; for obtaining the definition of a unit and for
converting numeric values between compatible units; and 3) an *note
extensive database of units: Database.

2 How This Package Differs from the Original `UDUNITS' Package
**************************************************************

The `UDUNIT-2' package differs from the `UDUNITS-1' package in the
following ways:
   * *Support for non-ASCII characters:* The `UDUNITS-1' package only
     supports the ASCII character set.  The `UDUNITS-2' package
     supports the following character sets: ASCII, ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1),
     and the UTF-8 encoding of ISO 10646 (Unicode).  This means that
     unit string specifications like "`µ°F·Ω⁻¹'" are now
     supported (your viewer must support UTF-8 to display this string
     correctly).

   * *Support for logarithmic units:*  The unit string specification
     "`0.1 lg(re 1 mW)'" specifies a deciBel unit with a one milliwatt
     reference level.  Such units are fully integrated into the package
     and all meaningful operations and conversions are supported.

   * *Persistent value converters:* It is now possible to obtain a
     _converter_ data-object, which can be used to convert numeric
     values in one unit to numeric values in another, compatible unit.
     The values can be `float', `double', or one-dimensional arrays of
     `float's or `double's.

   * *Improved API:*  Due to the above changes, it was not possible to
     keep the application programming interface (API) of the
     `UDUNITS-1' package.  The new interface, however, is easily
     understood and easy to use.  To support backward comptibility, the
     package does contain a version 1 C API, which uses the version 2
     library.

   * *XML unit database:*  The unit database is encoded using
     human-readable XML rather than a custom format.  The XML parser
     included in the package supports an _<import>_ element to allow
     easy and convenient customization.

   * *No Fortran or Perl API:*  Interfaces for these languages have not
     yet been created.  Contact <support-udunits@unidata.ucar.edu> if
     you are interested in helping to create these interfaces.


   One thing that has not changed is that almost all unit string
specifications understood by the `UDUNITS-1' package are also
understood by the `UDUNITS-2' package.  One exception is the symbol
`g', which in version 1 of the package was associated with standard
free fall (a unit of accelleration) but which is associated with the
unit gram in version 2 of the package.

3 Installing this Package
*************************

* Menu:

* Binary::              Installing from a binary distribution
* Source::              Installing from a source distribution


File: udunits2.info,  Node: Binary,  Next: Source,  Up: Installation

3.1 Installing from a Binary Distribution
=========================================

3.1.1 64-bit CentOS 6.4
-----------------------

If your operating system is compatible with 64-bit CentOS 6.4 (e.g.,
your system is 64-bit CentOS, Fedora, or RedHat), then create the file
`/etc/yum.repos.d/unidata.repo' with the following contents:

     [unidata]
     name=Unidata Repository
     baseurl=http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/repos/yum/CentOS/6/$basearch
     enabled=1

   You should then be able to install this package in the usual manner.
For example,

     su -
     yum install udunits

3.1.2 32-bit Ubuntu 12
----------------------

If your operating system is compatible with 32-bit Ubuntu 12 (precious
pangolin) (e.g., your system is 32-bit Debian or Ubuntu), then add the
following line to the file `/etc/apt/sources.list' or
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/unidata.list':

     deb http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/repos/apt i386/

   You should then be able to install this package in the usual manner.
For example,

     su -
     apt-get update
     apt-get install udunits

File: udunits2.info,  Node: Prerequisites,  Next: Obtain,  Up: Source

3.2.1 Prerequisites for This Package
------------------------------------

The Expat library and header-files must be installed. Look for the
library "libexpat" and the header-file "expat.h".

   If this package is to be tested (which is optional), then the CUnit
library and header-files must be installed. Look for the library
"libcunit" and the header-files "CUnit/CUnit.h" and "CUnit/Basic.h".

   If this package is to be built on a Windows system, then the CMake
and MinGW packages must be installed. Look for the utility "cmake" and
the directory/folder "MinGW".


File: udunits2.info,  Node: Obtain,  Next: Unix,  Prev: Prerequisites,  Up: Source

3.2.2 Obtaining this Package
----------------------------

Get the source for this package from its download-page at
`ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/udunits/' and unpack it in an
appropriate place. For example,

     su -
     cd /usr/local/src
     wget -O - ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/udunits/udunits-2.2.20-Source.tar.gz |
     gunzip -c | pax -r

3.2.3 Unix Installation Instructions
------------------------------------

* Menu:

* Autoconf::    Autoconf-based installation
* CMake::       CMake-based installation


File: udunits2.info,  Node: Autoconf,  Next: CMake,  Up: Unix

3.2.3.1 Autoconf-based Installation
...................................

Short instructions:

     ./configure [--prefix=ROOT] [--disable-shared] [CC=PATH]
     make
     make check                      # optional; requires CUNIT installation
     make install                    # also installs INFO documentation
     make install-html install-pdf   # optional
     make clean

   By default, the installation root is `/usr/local'.

   Long instructions:

  1. Go to the top-level source-directory of this package, e.g.,
          cd udunits-2.2.20

  2. If necessary, clean-up from a previous installation attempt by
     making the `distclean' target using the MAKE utility from step 2:
          MAKE distclean

     The option `--disable-shared' causes the build process to create a
     static library only: a sharable library is not created.  This
     option is necessary if the `libtool' utility that's included in
     this package can't build a sharable library using the given
     compiler.

  3. Execute the `configure' script.  Specify the installation prefix,
     the compiler from the previous step, and any required option.  For
     example, if you are on an HP-UX system and want to use the
     `/bin/c89' compiler and install under `/opt', then the following
     command is appropriate:

          ./configure --prefix=/opt --disable-shared CC=/bin/c89

     If the installation prefix is not specified, then the default is
     to install under `/usr/local'.

     If the compiler isn't specified, then the default is to use `gcc'.

  4. Build this package by making the default target using the MAKE
     utility from step 2:
          MAKE

  5. If you wish to verify that this package works correctly, then make
     the `check' target using the MAKE utility from step 2:
          MAKE check
     This step is only effective if the `configure' script found an
     installed `CUNIT' unit-testing package.  If that package wasn't
     found, then the above command will quickly exit without testing
     this package.

  6. Install the *note library: (udunits2lib)Top, *note utility:
     (udunits2prog)Top, header-files, units-database, and INFO
     documentation files by making the `install' target using the MAKE
     utility from step 2:
          MAKE install

  7. If desired, install the HTML and PDF documentation files by making
     one or more of the following targets using the MAKE utility from
     step 2:
          MAKE install-html install-pdf

  8. Clean up by making the `clean' target using the MAKE utility from
     step 2:
          MAKE clean


File: udunits2.info,  Node: CMake,  Prev: Autoconf,  Up: Unix

3.2.3.2 CMake-based Installation
................................

     cmake
     make all [test] install [install_test]

   where the arguments in square brackets are optional.


File: udunits2.info,  Node: Windows,  Prev: Unix,  Up: Source

3.2.4 Windows Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------

Currently, only a 32-bit MinGW (http://www.mingw.org)-based
installation is supported:

     cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
     cmake --build . [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=_dir_] -- all [test] install [install_test]

   where arguments in square brackets are optional.

   The default installation-prefix is "`C:\Program Files
(x86)\udunits-2.'MINOR.BUG", where MINOR and BUG are the minor version
and bug-fix level, respectively.
